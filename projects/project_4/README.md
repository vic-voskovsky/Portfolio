# Hackathon Project 4

Pick a tabular dataset and make a predictive model with it. 

## Timeline

- By 10:30am CST, Slack me what dataset you've chosen for the OK
- By 4pm, Slack me a link to your project repository; make frequent commits throughout the day
- At 4pm, we'll do lightning talks where you'll tell the rest of the class what you found; You will walk the class through your Jupyter notebook OR (if you'd like to) you can go through a short powerpoint

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. We're not expecting anything as polished as project two or three, for example. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least two models fit and scored. Supervised and unsupervised learning is welcome.

## Datasets

You can pick any dataset you're interested in, but pick one and Slack us the link by 11:30am. 

There are many curated collections of interesting datasets online. Here are a few links to get you started:

## Note

Do not duplicate someone else's analysis. :)

## Have fun!
